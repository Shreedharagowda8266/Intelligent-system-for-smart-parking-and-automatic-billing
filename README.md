**Intelligent system for Real-time parking and automatic billing**

**AIM:**
The aim of the project, IOT based fully automated parking system for vehicle parking stations implemented by microcontroller and the RFID module. The main aim of this project is reduces human interaction in parking area.

**OBJECTIVE:**
Optimizing Parking Space: Efficiently manage available parking spots by providing real-time data on available spaces and guiding drivers to open spots. This minimizes time spent searching for parking and reduces congestion.

Enhancing User Experience: Offer a seamless experience for drivers by providing user-friendly interfaces or apps that allow them to easily find parking, reserve spots, and navigate to their designated space.

Real-Time Monitoring: Employ sensors or cameras to monitor parking spaces in real time, allowing for accurate information on available spots and enabling immediate updates for drivers.

Automatic Billing: Implement a system that calculates parking fees based on duration and automatically bills users through various payment methods (e.g., credit card, mobile payment) upon exiting the parking area.

Integration and Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with different devices and platforms, making the system accessible to a wide range of users. Integration with navigation apps or in-car systems can further streamline the parking process.

Security and Safety: Employ measures to ensure the safety of vehicles and users within the parking area, including surveillance, emergency assistance features, and secure payment transactions.

Data Analysis and Optimization: Utilize data collected from the system to analyze parking patterns, peak times, and user behavior, enabling better resource allocation and future planning.

**COMPONENTS REQUIRED:**
Arduino uno
20*4 LCD display
12C LCD module
Mini servomotor SG-90
IR sensor
Jumper cable
Bread board
5V 2amp power adapter

**WORKING:**
•	To implement an intelligent system for real-time parking with automatic billing, you need a combination of hardware and software components.
•	Use sensors, cameras, or IoT devices to monitor each parking space in real-time.Employ image recognition or machine learning algorithms to identify whether a space is occupied or vacant.
•	Establish a reliable communication network to connect all the parking space sensors to a central server.Ensure low-latency communication for real-time updates.
•	Set up a centralized server that receives and processes data from parking space sensors.Implement algorithms to aggregate and analyse the data to determine parking space availability.
•	Implement a reservation system that allows users to reserve a parking space for a specific duration.
•	Integrate a secure payment gateway for automatic billing.
•	Track the duration of the parking session, calculate charges based on a predetermined rate, and process payments seamlessly.
